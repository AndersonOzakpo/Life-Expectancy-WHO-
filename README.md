### Project Overview

This analysis explores life expectancy data across various countries, analyzing the impact of factors such as adult mortality, education, economic status, and alcohol consumption on life expectancy. The findings aim to guide policymakers in implementing effective healthcare, education, and economic strategies to enhance life expectancy globally.

### Data Cleaning

The following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Removing duplicate values
4. Properly formatting the data

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA involved exploring the datasets to answer the following questions:
1. What are the general trends and patterns in life expectancy across different countries and regions?
2. How has life expectancy changed over time?
3. What factors influence life expectancy, such as GDP per capita, literacy rates, and health expenditure?
4. How do socioeconomic and health-related variables correlate with life expectancy?
5. What policy recommendations can be made to improve life expectancy based on the analysis?
6. How can countries with lower life expectancy improve their health outcomes?

### Data Modelling and Analysis

The following tasks were performed:
1. Definition and computation of derived metrics
2. Mapping relational datasets and tables

### Results or Findings
The analysis results are as follows:
1. A strong negative correlation between Adult Mortality and Life expectancy indicates that higher adult mortality rates are associated with lower life expectancy.
2. Education is positively correlated with Life expectancy. Countries with higher average years of schooling tend to have higher life expectancy.
3. Lower alcohol consumption is correlated with higher life expectancy, but excessive consumption leads to negative health outcomes.
4. Higher GDP per capita is associated with higher Life expectancy. Wealthier countries tend to have better healthcare systems and higher standards of living.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
1. Invest in healthcare infrastructure and programs such as providing access to medical care, vaccination programs, and public health initiatives targeting preventive healthcare.
2. Create more educational opportunities and access to schooling, especially in developing countries and rural communities.
3. While it is almost impossible to eradicate the consumption of alcohol, regulations on alcohol sales and advertising can also help mitigate the adverse effects of alcohol abuse. The implementation of public health campaigns to promote and raise awareness about the risks of excessive drinking and other positive lifestyle changes and rehabilitation.
4. Economic development should be a priority, but it should be inclusive and equitable. The government should provide favorable conditions for businesses to thrive and invest in skill acquisition and vocational training programs for the citizens.

### Limitations
The dataset did not have enough attributes and metrics to define certain insights such as gender distribution.
